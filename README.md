## Dependencies
This role does not have a hard dependency on any other role to deploy but rundeck does require java to be installed. smola's [ansible-java-role](https://github.com/smola/ansible-java-role) is a good choice with the
following configuration:

 * **Debian:** Ensure java_packages has a debian java package in it, i.e. openjdk-7-jre-headless
 * **RedHat:** Ensure java_packages has a debian java package in it, i.e. java-1.7.0-openjdk, had to adjust role to include RedHat.yml in main.yml to work.

If you choose to use a database then please ensure it is installed before executing this role. The following roles have been used to create databases:

 * **Ubuntu 12.04 & 14.04/PostgreSQL:** [postgresql](https://galaxy.ansible.com/list#/roles/512)
 * **Centos 6.5 & 7.0/PostgreSQL:** [postgresql-on-el6](https://galaxy.ansible.com/list#/roles/766) (with tweeks, watch this space for updates)
